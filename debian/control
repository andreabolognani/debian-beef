Description: flexible Brainfuck interpreter
 Beef is an interpreter for the Brainfuck programming language.
 .
 Its main goals are to be confortable for the user and to run most
 Brainfuck programs unchanged; speed is generally quite good. 
 .
 Beef performs thorough error checking to make sure malformed programs are
 not executed; it also supports a bunch of command-line options that can be
 used for configuration or compatibility purposes.
 .
 If GVFS is installed, Beef can use any available backend as either output
 or (where it makes sense) input source. GNU readline is used for
 interactive input.
